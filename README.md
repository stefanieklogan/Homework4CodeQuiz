## Project overview

* The main focus of this project required a demonstration of understanding JS. I took a completely different approach with this work and studied class activities again before diving into this work. In the end, it paid off to have prepared for the work vs more research on-the-spot. I also think it helped knowing what the homework requirements were so that I could 'earmark' different activities as references for quiz components.

## Psuedo code

* I did some psuedo coding for my index file. Most of my time psuedo coding was spent on my scoreboard.html file. I needed to write down the story of capturing scores, pulling from localStorage and rendering. I probably took the harder path by making a separate js file, but I wanted to prove to myself I understood the concept of localStorage from another page.

## Building the code & Java

* Is there a world record for the highest # of var in a js file? My biggest file to-date and probably only a fraction of the code I'll be writing 30 days from now. I am still working on writing small snippets of code, testing, committing and moving on. I find I'll write 5-10 lines and then debug for awhile.

## What I'm proud of most

* I am proud of how much html I wrote myself and debugged. What I mean by that is I have finally grasped the concept of a card/container and the importance of where a < / div > is placed in regards to layout, formatting and more.  

* I still have my inner demons when it comes to time researching format issues. Centering a container on a page keeps me up at night. Let it go, Elsa, let it go.
